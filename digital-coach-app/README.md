This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

# Notes from the 2021-2022 Team

## Use Case Flow

1. Create a profile and user account on the website
1. Choose an interview set or create your own (TODO)
1. Record videos and submit videos to firebase storage with answer doc (TODO)
1. Evaluate interview and store evaluation in firebase
1. View evaluation and feedback from interview

## How this app interfaces with the ML backend

You should note that our Next.JS app does not make any direct API calls to the backend, and only interacts with the firebase firestore database.

- When a user records an interview, a document of type answer is created under the interview associated with their profile in the path.
- This creation of document triggers a firebase function that queries the ML api to evaluate the interview
- These requests are put into a queue on the backend, and when evaluation is finished, the ML api makes a request to the functions server to update the answer document.
- The functions server then updates the answer document with the evaluation and feedback, which is viewable by the user.

## **TODO** items for the frontend

- Create and modify interview sets
- Connect dashboard to firebase with better metrics
- Refine dashboard to show more metrics and more accurate metrics
- Create a home page (lol)
- Create more responsive styling for the app as a whole
- Figure out deployment on vercel or any platform you choose. Vercel has great integration with next.js!

## The folder layout

### `/pages`

The pages directory is where you define your React pages. Use the file structure to mirror the links in your project.

### `/data` and `/assets`

The data and assets directories are two directories used to store seed file information. `/data` stores the interview questions, and `/assets` stores the interview videos.

### `/lib`

The lib directory is where the app interfaces with the firebase firestore service. It contains these interfaces as a class that can be called with react hooks creates inside these folders. Hooks should be prefixed with "use".

### `/components`

The components directory is where you define your React components. There are three different types of components: atoms, molecules, and organisms. Atoms are small, reusable pieces of UI that are used to build larger components. Molecules are small, reusable UI components that are used to build larger components with more dependencies on atoms, state, and hooks. Organisms are large, reusable UI components that are used to build larger components, which tend to have react queries and hooks. While these are not required, they are recommended to keep the components organized.

We recommend you make a decision on whether to include the scss files in the styles folder or next to the components in this folder. As you can see, we did not make a decision on this.

### `/functions`

The functions directory is where the functions server is build out of. This contains the source code for the listener on the answers collection, and the endpoint for the ML api to call. The functions server is used to update the answer document with the evaluation and feedback. Make sure to build this folder before emulating the firebase services.

### `/util`

This contains some basic helper functions that don't fit any other category.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
