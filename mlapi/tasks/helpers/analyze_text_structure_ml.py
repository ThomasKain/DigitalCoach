    I got a job at this new tech company and they asked me to work on their frontend. I really didn't know what I was doing but I tried my best anyway. The problem was that the website kept crashing whenever users would try to submit forms. I looked into the code and found some issues with the validation logic. I had to fix it quickly because customers were complaining. So I went through the code line by line and found that there was an error in the JavaScript validation that was causing the form submissions to fail silently. I implemented proper error handling and added some better user feedback. After deploying my changes, the forms started working correctly and customer complaints dropped by 90%. My manager was really happy with my work and mentioned it in our next team meeting.

Situation: Last year, our company's website was experiencing significant performance issues, with load times exceeding 15 seconds during peak hours. This was causing a 25% drop in user engagement and negatively impacting sales conversions.

Task: As the lead front-end developer, I was tasked with identifying the root causes of the performance bottlenecks and implementing solutions to reduce page load time to under 3 seconds without sacrificing functionality.

Action: First, I conducted a comprehensive performance audit using Lighthouse and WebPageTest to identify specific issues. I discovered that unoptimized images, render-blocking JavaScript, and excessive HTTP requests were the primary culprits. Then, I created a detailed improvement plan with clear milestones and priorities. I implemented lazy loading for images, minified and bundled JavaScript files, leveraged browser caching, and introduced a CDN for static assets. Additionally, I refactored our CSS to eliminate redundant code and improved critical rendering path optimization.

Result: Within three weeks, we reduced average page load time from 15 seconds to just 2.4 seconds, exceeding our target. User engagement increased by 30%, and our conversion rate improved by 15%. The CEO highlighted this achievement in the quarterly all-hands meeting, and my approach was adopted as a best practice for future development work across the organization.
