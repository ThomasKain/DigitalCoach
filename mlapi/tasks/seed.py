            Interviewer: Hi Alex, thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. To kick things off, could you tell me about a recent software project you worked on and a specific technical challenge you had to overcome?

            Marzia Bartalotti: Hi, yes, absolutely. Um, to be honest, I'm a little bit nervous, but I'm really excited to be here. So, recently, I worked on a full-stack web application. The biggest hurdle was definitely optimizing the database queries. Initially, the main user dashboard was loading incredibly slowly—it was taking almost five seconds to render. I felt pretty frustrated because I just couldn't figure out the bottleneck at first.

            Interviewer: That does sound stressful. How did you end up resolving it?

            Marzia Bartalotti: Well, I stepped back, dug into the documentation, and realized I was making a classic N+1 query error. Once I understood the root of the problem, I felt a lot more confident. I restructured the backend logic to use batch processing and implemented some basic indexing. Seeing the load time drop to under 200 milliseconds was incredibly rewarding. I'm actually really proud of how that turned out.

            Interviewer: Thanks for joining us, Mariza. Can you describe a time you had to lead a team through a significant technical pivot?

            Mariza Bartalotti: Absolutely. Last year at CloudSync, we were halfway through a legacy migration when we realized our chosen microservices framework couldn't handle the projected concurrency spikes for Q4. It was a high-stakes moment. I called an emergency sync, presented the load-test data, and proposed a shift to a Go-based architecture for the edge services. 

            Interviewer: That's a big shift mid-project. How did the team react to the change in stack?

            Mariza Bartalotti: There was initial resistance because of the learning curve, but I organized a three-day 'internal boot camp' to get everyone up to speed. By leading the first few pull requests myself, I showed the team that the developer experience was actually better. We hit our Q4 targets with 99.99% uptime, and the pivot actually reduced our infrastructure costs by 15% due to better resource efficiency.
